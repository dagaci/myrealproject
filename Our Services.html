The person launching the investigation explains why they suspect deceit and hands over any evidence they have supporting their claims. A good fraud investigator will use this initial information to find more evidence and information. <br>In law, fraud is intentional deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right.  <br></h6>
